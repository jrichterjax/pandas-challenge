Notes:

In order to place Per Student Bedget values into bins, I reformatted the Per Student Budget field back to a float using code from Stack Overflow found here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32464280/converting-currency-with-to-numbers-in-python-pandas


Summary:

The following analysis provides a quick summary of the school district as a whole before providing a snapshot of each school. The schools' performances are then ranked highest and lowest by overall percentage of students passing. In order to achieve a deeper understanding of the results, scores and passing rates are then grouped by grade, per student spending, school size and school type. 


Additional (My Own) Findings:

* Charter schools demonstrated comparable results in math and reading at each school, whereas district schools demonstrated significantly lower results in math compared to reading at each school. 

* Grade level did not present any significant changes or trends in scores.

* Between charter and district schools, there is a far greater difference in passing percentages than in average scores indicating a much wider range in scores at district schools and implying that the lowest performing students at district schools are much farther behind their peers than the lowest performing students at charter schools.
